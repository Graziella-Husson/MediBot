    I don't feel well
    It hurts
    I'm not so good
    Not so well
    I'm not very well
    My heart is breaking
    I will die
    I feel dizzy
    I'm unwell
    I am frail
    I'm feeble
    I just don't feel well
    i have some pain
    I have some struggle
    I'm not doing well
    Don't ok
    I am gonna die
    I am going to die
    It's hard
    i don't feel as bad as yesterday
    i feel some discomfort
    i cannot concentrate
    the disease is Terrifying
    the discomfort is high 
    I want to die
    i am distroyed
    a little struggle inside
    Something inside
    I can't take more
    I can't do anything 
    I can't continue anymore
    I will no make it
    Don't do anything
    Help me
    I feel very bad
    I'm bad
    I feel bad
    I do not feel this good
    I am not good
    I am not ok
    This is not good
    I can't live with this thing
    It's too hard
    I am going to die
    It is hard to live
    I feel unwell
    I am dizzy
    I am not this well
    I feel something
    Help me, it's to hard
    I do not like that 
    I am begging
    This is wrong
    This is worse    
    I have tears in my eyes
    This is not ok
    I will not continue
    I want to stop it
    This going to be worse with time
    It can't be good
    It's disappointing
    I have some difficulties
    This is an error
    I am exhausted
    I am falling
    I feel feeble
    I have a heartache
    I feel heartless
    I am inefficient
    I am lethargic
    Malaise
    This is painfull
    I want to runaway
    This is sorrowful
    This is faithless
    I will certainly not make it
    Hard to make it
    I feel miserable
    My heart is broken
    Unwell
    Quite bad
    I am unwell
    So painful    
    Life is hard
    Quite struggling
